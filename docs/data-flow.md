# Data Flow Architecture

This document traces how data moves between the extension's components, what
gets serialized at each boundary, and the message protocols that connect them.

## Component Overview

The extension has three components, each running in a separate Chrome extension context
(isolated JS environment with its own globals and lifecycle). They communicate via
Chrome's message passing APIs.
Chrome **JSON-serializes** all data crossing boundaries between contexts — no class instances,
Maps, Sets, or functions survive the trip. Game state objects must be explicitly serialized before sending and reconstructed
on the receiving side.

### Content Script

Runs in the **MAIN world** of the BGA game page. Returns raw extraction data to the
*Background Service Worker*.

Must be fully self-contained — injected via `chrome.scripting.executeScript()`, so any
references to module-level code are undefined after Chrome serializes the function.

Responsibilities:
- Read player names and initial hand from `gameui.*` globals
- Fetch full notification history via BGA's API
- Package results as `RawExtractionData`

Key files:
- `src/extract.ts` — data extraction from BGA page globals and API

### Background Service Worker

Persistent orchestrator. Processes raw extraction data into game state and pushes
results to the *Side Panel*.

Responsibilities:
- Inject the *Content Script* into BGA game pages
- Run game-specific processing pipelines (raw packets -> game log -> game state)
- Push results to the *Side Panel* (no request/response — push-only model)
- Manage toolbar icon/badge animations
- Coordinate live tracking (watcher injection, rate-limited re-extraction with deferred catch-up)
- Handle navigation events and auto-hide logic

Key files:
- `src/background.ts` — orchestration, message handling, icon/badge, live tracking
- `src/games/*/process_log.ts` — raw BGA packets to structured game log
- `src/games/*/game_state.ts` — game log to game state, serialization

### Side Panel

Extension page. Receives `PipelineResults` (raw data, game log, and serialized game state)
pushed from the *Background Service Worker*, renders interactive HTML in the browser side panel.

Responsibilities:
- Receive pushed results from the *Background Service Worker* and render game-specific HTML summaries
- Manage UI state (toggles, zoom, section visibility) with localStorage persistence
- Generate self-contained ZIP downloads with inlined assets
- Maintain connection lifecycle (reconnect on service worker restart)

Key files:
- `src/sidepanel/sidepanel.ts` — UI logic, message handling, downloads, zoom, toggles
- `src/games/*/render.ts` — game-specific HTML rendering
- `src/render/help.ts` — help page content
- `src/render/toggle.ts` — shared toggle/tooltip logic (used by both side panel and ZIP export)

## Data Flow: Full Extraction

Extracts game data from a BGA page, processes it through a game-specific pipeline,
and delivers the result to the *Side Panel* for rendering. Both supported and
unsupported games follow the same flow — the difference is whether the pipeline
processes the data or passes it through as raw-only.

Triggers:
- User clicks the extension icon
- User presses the keyboard shortcut (`toggle-sidepanel`)
- User switches to a tab with a BGA game table
- Page finishes loading on a BGA game URL
- Window focus changes to a window with a BGA game tab

---

***Background Service Worker***

1. Classify the current tab URL via `background.classifyNavigation()`:
   - `"extract"` — supported game, continue below
   - `"unsupportedGame"` — BGA game table but unsupported game, continue below
   - `"showHelp"` — not a BGA game page, send `"notAGame"` to *Side Panel*
2. Determine gameName and tableNumber, lock against concurrent extractions
3. Send `"loading"` message to *Side Panel* (supported games only)
4. Inject `dist/extract.js` into the BGA page

```
⇩   (no data passed to Content Script)
```

***Content Script***

1. Read player names and current hand contents from `gameui.gamedatas`
2. Fetch full notification history via `gameui.ajaxcall()`
3. Package results as `RawExtractionData`

```
⇩   RawExtractionData (auto-serialized by Chrome):
⇩   { players, gamedatas: {my_hand, cards}, packets: RawPacket[], currentPlayerId }
```

***Background Service Worker*** — branches here based on classification:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Supported game (<code>"extract"</code>)</th>
<th>Unsupported game (<code>"unsupportedGame"</code>)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

***Background Service Worker***

1. Transform raw data via `background.runPipeline()`:
   - Innovation: `process_log.processRawLog()` &rarr; `GameState.processLog()` &rarr; `GameState.toJSON()`
   - Azul: `process_log.processAzulLog()` &rarr; `game_state.processLog()` &rarr; `game_state.toJSON()`
2. Cache `PipelineResults` (with `gameLog` and `gameState`)
3. Push results to *Side Panel*
4. Inject live watcher (sets up Live Tracking)

</td>
<td valign="top">

***Background Service Worker***

1. Cache `PipelineResults` with `rawData` only (`gameLog` and `gameState` are `null`)
2. Push results to *Side Panel*

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

```
⇩   "resultsReady" message with PipelineResults payload:
⇩   { gameName, tableNumber, rawData, gameLog, gameState }
```

***Side Panel***

1. Reconstruct live objects from serialized state:
   - Innovation: fetch `card_info.json`, call `GameState.fromJSON()`
   - Azul: call `game_state.fromJSON()`
2. Generate HTML, set up tooltips/toggles/zoom

</td>
<td valign="top">

```
⇩   "resultsReady" message with PipelineResults payload:
⇩   { gameName, tableNumber, rawData, gameLog: null, gameState: null }
```

***Side Panel***

1. Detect `gameState` is `null` — show help page
2. Enable download button (ZIP contains only `raw_data.json`)

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Data Flow: Live Tracking

Keeps the *Side Panel* in sync as the game progresses by detecting DOM changes
and re-running the extraction pipeline. Initiated by the watcher injection in
[Full Extraction](#data-flow-full-extraction) step 4.

---

***Content Script*** (watcher)

1. Observe DOM mutations on `#logs` / `#game_play_area` via `MutationObserver`
2. Wait for changes to settle (2000ms quiet period) before notifying

```
⇩   "gameLogChanged" message
```

***Background Service Worker***

1. Validate re-extraction guards:
   - Sender tab matches tracked live tab
   - *Side Panel* is open
   - No extraction currently in progress
   - At least 5 seconds since last extraction
2. If rate-limited (less than 5s since last extraction): schedule a deferred
   re-extraction after the remaining time. Only one deferred timer is active at
   a time; subsequent mutations within the same window are coalesced.
3. If all guards pass, re-run Full Extraction flow silently (clear any deferred timer)
4. Only push results to *Side Panel* if packet count increased

## Data Flow: Side Panel Connect

When the *Side Panel* opens (or reconnects after a service worker restart), the
*Background Service Worker* pushes any cached results immediately. This eliminates
request/response round trips — the side panel never polls for data.

Triggers:
- User opens the side panel (via extension icon or keyboard shortcut)
- Service worker restarts while the side panel is open

---

***Side Panel***

1. Start in help page state by default
2. Establish port via `chrome.runtime.connect({name: "sidepanel"})`

```
⇩   Port connection event
```

***Background Service Worker***

1. If cached `lastResults` exists: push `"resultsReady"` with the cached `PipelineResults` payload
2. If `lastResults` is `null` (e.g. after service worker restart): query the active tab
   and run `background.resolveContent()` to extract fresh results

```
⇩   "resultsReady" message with PipelineResults payload (if available)
```

***Side Panel***

1. If results received with `gameState`: render game page
2. If results received without `gameState`: show help page with download enabled
3. If no results: remain on help page until a Full Extraction completes

## Data Flow: ZIP Download

Packages current game data and a self-contained HTML summary into a downloadable ZIP file.

Triggers:
- User clicks the download button in the *Side Panel*

---

***Side Panel***

1. Use cached `PipelineResults` from the last render
2. For supported games: generate self-contained HTML page via `render.renderFullPage()` with all assets inlined as base64 data URIs
3. Package into ZIP via JSZip:
   - `raw_data.json` — original BGA packets
   - `game_log.json` — structured log entries (supported games only)
   - `game_state.json` — serialized game state (supported games only)
   - `summary.html` — self-contained HTML (supported games only)
4. For unsupported games: ZIP contains only `raw_data.json`
5. Download as `bgaa_<tableNumber>_<moveId>.zip`

## Message Protocol

### *Side Panel* &rarr; *Background Service Worker*

| Message | Response | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `"getPinMode"` | `PinMode` | Get current auto-hide mode |
| `"setPinMode"` | — | Set auto-hide mode (persisted to `chrome.storage.local`) |
| `"pauseLive"` | — | Stop live tracking |
| `"resumeLive"` | — | Re-inject watcher on active tab |

### *Background Service Worker* &rarr; *Side Panel*

| Message | Payload | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `"loading"` | — | Show loading spinner |
| `"resultsReady"` | `{ results: PipelineResults }` | Push extraction results for rendering |
| `"notAGame"` | — | Current tab is not a BGA game page — show help |
| `"gameError"` | `{ error: string }` | Extraction failed — show help with error message |
| `"liveStatus"` | `{ active: boolean }` | Update live tracking indicator |

### *Content Script* &rarr; *Background Service Worker*

| Message | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `"gameLogChanged"` | DOM mutation detected — trigger live re-extraction |

## Connection Management

The *Side Panel* maintains a persistent port via `chrome.runtime.connect({name: "sidepanel"})`.
The *Background Service Worker* uses port connection/disconnection to track whether the
*Side Panel* is open.

On port connect, the *Background Service Worker* immediately pushes any cached results
(see [Side Panel Connect](#data-flow-side-panel-connect)). If no results are cached
(e.g. after a service worker restart), it queries the active tab and triggers extraction
so the side panel receives fresh data without needing to request it.

If the service worker restarts (Chrome may terminate idle workers), the port disconnects.
The *Side Panel* retries connection every 1 second and shows a "disconnected" indicator
after 3 seconds.

## Asset Resolution

Game renderers accept an asset resolver function rather than hardcoding paths:

- **In extension**: `chrome.runtime.getURL("assets/bga/innovation/icons/hex_5.png")`
  produces `chrome-extension://<id>/assets/bga/innovation/icons/hex_5.png`
- **For ZIP export**: resolver returns relative path `"assets/bga/..."`, then
  `inlineAssets()` replaces all such references with base64 data URIs

This dual-mode resolution lets the same render code serve both live display and
self-contained HTML exports.
