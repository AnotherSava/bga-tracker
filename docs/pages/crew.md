Tracks played cards and communication signals to deduce remaining cards in players' hands for [The Crew: Mission Deep Sea](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/324856/the-crew-mission-deep-sea) tables with any player count. The side panel displays three sections — a card grid, a player-suit matrix, and a trick history — all updating live as cards are played.

### Card grid

Shows all 40 cards (9 cards of each of the 4 coloured suits and 4 submarine trumps) with visual states: dimmed for played cards, neutral for cards in your hand, and bright for cards still in opponents' hands:

### Player-suit matrix

Shows what information we know about players having different suits: "X" (the player has no cards of that suit), "!" (confirmed holding), or "?" (unknown) per player per suit. Suit absence is detected automatically from trick-following behavior, and communication data narrows down holdings further:

### Trick history

Chronological table of all tricks with lead and winner highlights. The current in-progress trick appears below a dashed separator:
