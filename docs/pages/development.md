## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Chrome 141+

### Install

```
npm install
npm run build
```

### Install from source

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top-right corner)
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select this project's root directory
4. The BGA Assistant icon appears in the Chrome toolbar

## Data processing CLI

Two CLI scripts run the extension's pipeline stages locally for debugging, using the same artifacts saved by the ZIP download.

### game-log

Reads `raw_data.json`, auto-detects the game from the `gameName` field, runs the game-specific log processor, and writes `game_log.json` to the same directory. If the file lacks a `gameName` field (e.g. older exports), specify `--game <name>` (innovation, azul, thecrewdeepsea).

```
npm run game-log -- data/bgaa_823235522_23/raw_data.json
```

### game-state

Reads `game_log.json`, runs the engine and serialization pipeline, and writes `game_state.json` to the same directory. If the file lacks a `gameName` field, specify `--game <name>`. With `--debug`, also creates a `game_states/` subfolder with per-entry snapshots named by turn and entry index (`0001_0042.json`, `0001_0043.json`, etc.).

```
npm run game-state -- data/bgaa_823235522_23/game_log.json [--debug]
```

### Data flow

See [Data Flow Architecture](data-flow) for the full data flow architecture, message protocols, and connection management details.

## Testing

Tests use vitest and cover the full pipeline: types, log processing, game engine, serialization, rendering, and extension entry points.

```
npm test                        # Run all tests
npx vitest run --coverage       # Run with coverage report
```
