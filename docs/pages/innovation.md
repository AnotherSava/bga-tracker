Reads the full game log from [Innovation](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/63888/innovation) 2-player tables and reconstructs the game state — hand contents and score piles according to revealed cards, and deck stack order with returned cards — displayed as a visual summary in a side panel. Supports the base game and the Echoes of the Past and Cities of Destiny expansions.

### Hands, forecast and score

Each of those sections shows known cards with their name, icons, and age, while unknown cards appear as placeholders with just the age number and set. An eye icon represents opponent's knowledge:

### Turn history

A compact sidebar shows recent actions — meld, draw, dogma, endorse, achieve, promote — with timestamps and player attribution. Compound actions (e.g. meld → promote → dogma) render as indented sub-action lines:

### Card list

The card list lays out all cards in the game across ages, showing which cards have been identified and which remain unknown. Toggle between Base, Echoes, and Cities sets, filter to show only unaccounted cards, and switch between wide and tall layouts:
