# BGA Tracker

Board games have a lot of information that is technically public but hard to track mentally. In turn-based games on [Board Game Arena](https://boardgamearena.com) this is even worse — hours or days pass between turns, and whatever you noticed earlier is long forgotten. Recovering it means scrolling through pages of game logs. This project does it for you and presents a brief, readable summary.

My initial focus is on 2p games of **Innovation** with Cities of Destiny expansion. No more struggling to remember:
- deck stack order after consecutive Alchemy or Physics calls, or returning cards after playing a city
- cards kept in the opponent's hand after melding a particular city
- cards revealed with Oars


## How it works

There are two ways to extract game data from BGA:

**Chrome extension (recommended):** A Chrome extension adds a toolbar button. Clicking it on a BGA Innovation game page extracts the game data and sends it to a local server that runs the processing pipeline.

**Playwright pipeline:** A Playwright-controlled browser navigates to the BGA game page and fetches the full notification history via the BGA API.

In both cases:
1. A JS script extracts card transfer events into a structured game log
2. A Python script replays every card movement from the log, tracking current locations, deck stack order, and which cards the opponent knows about
3. A formatter produces a colored HTML summary of the current game state from both perspectives

Player names are detected automatically from the game log. The `PLAYER_NAME` in `.env` determines which side is "me" vs "opponent".

## Setup

```
python -m venv venv
pip install -e .
pip install Pillow  # optional, for download_assets
playwright install chromium
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```
PLAYER_NAME=YourBGAUsername

# Default section visibility (format_state.py)
# Deck sections: show / hide
DEFAULT_BASE_DECK=show
DEFAULT_CITIES_DECK=hide
# List sections: none / all / unknown
DEFAULT_BASE_LIST=none
DEFAULT_CITIES_LIST=none
# List layout: wide / tall
DEFAULT_BASE_LIST_LAYOUT=wide
DEFAULT_CITIES_LIST_LAYOUT=wide

# Section placement: column.position (e.g. 1.3 = column 1, 3rd section)
# All in column 1 by default; set column 2+ to create multi-column layout
SECTION_HAND_OPPONENT=1.1
SECTION_HAND_ME=1.2
SECTION_SCORE_OPPONENT=1.3
SECTION_SCORE_ME=1.4
SECTION_BASE_DECK=1.5
SECTION_CITIES_DECK=1.6
SECTION_BASE_LIST=1.7
SECTION_CITIES_LIST=1.8
```

Only `PLAYER_NAME` is required. All other settings are optional with sensible defaults.

Icon and card image assets are committed to the repo in `assets/`. To regenerate them from the upstream BGA sprite sheets (requires Pillow):
```
python -m bga_tracker.innovation.download_assets
```

## Chrome Extension

### Extension setup

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top-right corner)
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `extension/` directory in this project
4. The Innovation tracker icon appears in the Chrome toolbar

### Usage with Chrome extension

1. Start the local server:
   ```
   python -m bga_tracker.innovation.pipeline serve
   ```
   The server runs on port 8787 by default. Use `--port` to change it (note: the Chrome extension expects port 8787; update `SERVER_URL` in `extension/background.js` if using a different port).

2. Navigate to your BGA Innovation game in Chrome

3. Click the Innovation tracker icon in the toolbar
   - Badge shows "..." while extracting
   - Badge shows a green checkmark on success
   - Badge shows red "ERR" on failure

4. The server processes the game data and generates `summary.html` in `data/<TABLE_ID> <opponent>/`

## Usage

### Pipeline (Playwright)

The pipeline automates the full workflow in a single command:

```
python -m bga_tracker.innovation.pipeline run URL [--no-open] [--skip-fetch]
```

Example:
```
python -m bga_tracker.innovation.pipeline run "https://boardgamearena.com/10/innovation?table=815951228"
```

This will:
1. Launch a browser and navigate to the game page
2. Fetch the full notification history from BGA
3. Process the raw data into a structured game log
4. Track all card movements and build game state
5. Generate a colored HTML summary
6. Open `summary.html` in your default browser

Options:
- `--no-open` — skip opening the browser at the end
- `--skip-fetch` — reuse an existing `raw_log.json` instead of fetching from BGA (useful for re-processing without a live session)

On first run you must be logged in to BGA. If the pipeline detects you are not logged in, it will tell you to log in first via:
```
python -m browser.browse https://boardgamearena.com
```

### Manual workflow

You can also run each step individually:

#### 1. Start the browser helper

```
python -m browser.browse
```

This opens a persistent Chrome session. Commands are sent by writing to `scripts/cmd.txt`; results appear in `output/result.txt`.

#### 2. Extract game log

Send these commands (one at a time, waiting for each result):
```
goto https://boardgamearena.com/<N>/innovation/innovation?table=TABLE_ID
eval scripts/fetch_full_history.js
eval scripts/innovation/extract_log.js
```

Save the final output to `data/<TABLE_ID>/game_log.json`.

#### 3. Track card state

```
python -m bga_tracker.innovation.track_state TABLE_ID
```

Produces `game_state.json` — structured game state with card objects.

#### 4. Format summary

```
python -m bga_tracker.innovation.format_state TABLE_ID
```

Produces `summary.html` — a colored HTML page showing deck contents, hands, and scores from both perspectives. Open it in a browser.

On first run, renames the data folder to include the opponent name (e.g. `809765534 jamdalla`). Subsequent runs find the renamed folder automatically.

```

## Testing

Regression tests replay the full pipeline on committed fixture data and compare output to reference files.

```
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Fixtures live in `tests/innovation/fixtures/` — each subfolder contains a `game_log.json` (input) and the expected `game_state.json` + `summary.html` (reference output).

## Output format

### game_state.json

Structured game state with card objects. Card metadata (age, color, icons) is looked up from `card_info.json` by name — not duplicated in the output.

```json
{
  "actual_deck": {
    "1": {
      "base": [null, {"name": "Sailing", "revealed": false}],
      "cities": [null, null]
    }
  },
  "board": { "Player1": [{"name": "Clothing"}] },
  "hand":  { "Player1": [{"name": "Optics", "revealed": false}, {"age": 5, "set": 0}] },
  "score": { "Player1": [{"name": "The Wheel", "revealed": false}, {"age": 3, "set": 0}] },
  "achievements": [{"name": "Oars"}, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]
}
```

- **Resolved card** (hand/score): `{"name": "...", "revealed": false}` — `revealed` placeholder (always false for now)
- **Unresolved card** (hand/score): `{"age": int, "set": int}` — `0` = base, `3` = cities
- **Board card**: `{"name": "..."}` — always public
- **Deck entry**: `null` (unresolved) or `{"name": "...", "revealed": false}`
- **Achievement**: `{"name": "..."}` or `null` — age implied by index + 1
- `actual_deck`: ordered draw piles per (age, set). Index 0 = top. Only ages with cards remaining.

### download_assets.py

Downloads sprite sheets from the [bga-innovation](https://github.com/micahstairs/bga-innovation) GitHub repo and extracts individual assets:
- 30 resource icons (6 types x 5 colors) from `resource_icons.jpg`
- 210 hex icons (105 base + 105 cities) from `hexagon_icons.png`
- 11 bonus icons from `bonus_icons.png`
- 20 cities special icons from `cities_special_icons.png`
- 210 card face images (105 base + 105 cities) from `misc/cards/`

Assets are committed to the repo, so this only needs to be re-run if upstream images change.

### summary.html

![summary.html example](screenshots/summary.png)

Dark-themed HTML page with visual card elements. Each card shows its color, resource/hex icons, name (base) or icons-only (cities), and age number. Hovering a base card shows the full card face image; hovering a cities card shows name and dogma text.

Sections:
- **Hand — opponent** — cards sorted by age (known before unknown per age)
- **Hand — me** — two rows: hidden (closed-eye icon) and revealed (open-eye icon)
- **Score — opponent/me** — same layout (omitted if empty)
- **Base deck** — draw pile by age `[Hide|Show]`
- **Cities deck** — draw pile by age `[Hide|Show]`
- **Base list** — all 105 base cards `[None|All|Unknown]` `[Wide|Tall]`
- **Cities list** — all 105 cities cards `[None|All|Unknown]` `[Wide|Tall]`

Section toggles:
- `[Hide|Show]` — collapse/expand section content
- `[None|All|Unknown]` — hide, show all, or show only cards not accounted for elsewhere (hand, score, board, deck). Known cards are masked as gray unknowns in Unknown mode.
- `[Wide|Tall]` — Wide shows one row per age; Tall shows 5 color columns (BRGYP) with age labels on the left

Default visibility and layout for each section can be configured in `.env`. Sections can also be arranged into multiple page columns using `SECTION_*` placement values (see Setup).

Card layout:
- Base (set 0): 2x3 CSS grid — hex icon + name in top row, resource icons + age in bottom row
- Cities (set 3): 2x2 CSS grid — 6 icons in two rows, age in bottom-right, name only in tooltip
- Unknown cards: gray cards showing age number (or blank in deck rows)

Color order: BRGYP (blue, red, green, yellow, purple) throughout.

Fonts: Barlow Condensed for card names, Russo One for age numbers.

## Innovation-specific notes

### Deck stack tracking

Separate draw piles per (age, set). Cards drawn from top, returned to bottom.

Initialization from `card_info.json`:
- Base ages 1-9: card count minus 1 (achievement removed)
- Base age 1: additionally minus 2 per player (initial deal, not logged)
- Base age 10: full count
- Cities all ages: full count

### Set identification

`extract_log.js` extracts the BGA `type` field from spectator notifications:
- BGA type `0` = base (set 0 in card_info.json)
- BGA type `2` = cities (set 3 in card_info.json)

Hidden transfers include "from base" or "from cities" suffix in the extracted log.

### Card tracking architecture

The tracker uses a candidate-set model (`card.py`, `game_state.py`, `game_state_tracker.py`, `game_log_processor.py`):

- Each card slot is a `Card` object with a mutable set of candidate names that shrinks as information is revealed (draws, melds, reveals, transfers). A card is "resolved" when candidates narrow to a single name.
- All card movements are represented as uniform `Action` dataclasses (source, dest, card_index, group_key, players)
- `GameLogProcessor` parses log entries into Actions; `GameStateTracker.move()` handles all movements through a single method
- Constraint propagation runs per (age, set) group: singleton elimination, hidden singles, naked subsets, and suspect propagation
- Achievements are deduced from remaining hidden base cards
- A transient "revealed" zone handles draw-and-reveal sequences (deck → revealed → hand/board/deck)

### Opponent knowledge model

Each card tracks what the opponent knows about it:

- `opponent_knows_exact` — opponent definitely knows this card's identity (saw it drawn, revealed, transferred, or deduced via suspect propagation)
- `opponent_might_suspect` — set of names the opponent could associate with this card (empty = no info)
- `suspect_list_explicit` — whether the suspect list is closed/complete

When our card moves between private zones (hand/score → deck/hand/score), the opponent can't tell which card moved. All same-group cards at the source lose certainty: suspect lists are merged into a union, and `opponent_knows_exact` is cleared.

Suspect propagation: when a card is publicly revealed, its name is removed from other cards' suspect lists in the same group. If an explicit suspect list narrows to one name, the opponent is deduced to know that card too.

### Name resolution

BGA lowercases some words in card names (e.g. "The wheel" vs "The Wheel"). The tracker uses case-insensitive lookup.
